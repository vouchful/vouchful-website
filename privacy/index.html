              <section>
  <p>At Vouchful, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>
    <li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>
    <li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h4>Summary</h4>
  <p>Vouchful makes available services that include our web sites (http://www.vouchful.com (the "Site")), our blog, our API, and any other software, sites, and services offered by Vouchful in connection to any of those (taken together, the "Service"). It is Vouchful's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our Site.</p>
  <p>Vouchful will collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you as you use our sites. We may use this data to better understand our users. We can also publish this data, but the data will be about a large group of users, not individuals. We may also collect certain personal information about you and your use of the Service which may be published and used in the aggregate as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
  <p>We will also ask you to provide personal information, but you'll always be able to opt out. If you give us personal information, we won't do anything evil with it.</p>
  <p>We can also use cookies, but you can choose not to store these.</p>
  <p>That's the basic idea, but you must read through the entire Privacy Policy below and agree with all the details before you use any of our sites.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h4>Reuse</h4>
  <p>This document is based upon the <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Automattic Privacy Policy</a> and is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License 2.5</a>. Basically, this means you can use it verbatim or edited, but you must release new versions under the same license and you have to credit Automattic somewhere (like this!). Automattic is not connected with and does not sponsor or endorse Vouchful or its use of the work.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h4>Visitors</h4>
  <p>Like most website operators, Vouchful collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Vouchful's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Vouchful's visitors use its website. From time to time, Vouchful may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
  <p>Vouchful also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Vouchful does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of Service.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
  <p>Certain visitors to Vouchful's websites choose to interact with Vouchful in ways that require Vouchful to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Vouchful gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Vouchful collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Vouchful. Vouchful does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4>
  <p>Vouchful may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to and users of the Service. For instance, Vouchful may monitor the most popular parts of the Vouchful Site. Vouchful may display this information in the aggregate publicly or provide it to others.</p>
  <p>Vouchful does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
  <p>Vouchful discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Vouchful's behalf or to provide services available at Vouchful's Site websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Vouchful will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Vouchful discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Vouchful believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Vouchful, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, Vouchful may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Vouchful and our products. We primarily use our website and blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Vouchful takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h4>Cookies</h4>
  <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the Service each time the visitor returns. Vouchful uses cookies to help Vouchful identify and track visitors, their usage of Vouchful Service, and their Service access preferences. Vouchful visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Vouchful's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Vouchful's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h4>Business Transfers</h4>
  <p>If Vouchful, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Vouchful goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Vouchful may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>  
</section>
<section>
  <h4>Data Storage</h4>
  <p>Vouchful uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service. You understand that although you retain full rights to your data, it may be stored on third party storage and transmitted through third party networks.</p>  
</section>
<section>
  <h4>Data Retention</h4>
  <p>We store the information we collect for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.</p>  
</section>
<section>
  <h4>Security</h4>
  <p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>  
</section>
<section>
  <h4>Choices</h4>
  <p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Opt-Out of Electronic Communications: You may opt out of receiving news and informational messages from us. Just follow the instructions in those messages.</li>
    <li>Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies: At this time, Vouchful does not respond to "do not track" signals across all of our Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Vouchful's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Vouchful's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</li>
  </ul>  
</section>
<section>
  <h4>Your Rights</h4>
  <p>If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (AKA the "GDPR"), data protection laws give you rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Request access to your personal data;</li>
    <li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>
    <li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>
    <li>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and</li>
    <li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using the tools that we offer, but if you aren't able to do that, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@vouchful.com">hello@vouchful.com</a>. EU individuals also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.</p>  
</section>
<section>
  <h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
  <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Vouchful may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Vouchful's sole discretion. Vouchful encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy. That's it! Thanks for reading.</p>
